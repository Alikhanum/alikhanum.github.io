Greetings! My name is Alikhan Umirbayev (Älihan Ömırbai) and I from Almaty, Kazakhstan. I am a first year PhD student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Professor. Ross Murch](https://eermurch.home.ece.ust.hk/). I finished a BEng degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering with first-class honours from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), where I received 4-year Top Scholarship, and [MSc in Telecommunications](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/academics/taught-postgraduate/msc-telecom) at the HKUST.

My research interests include antenna design, radio-frequency (RF) circuits, and devices for 5G/6G wireless communication. I am currently working on a Time-Modulated Antenna Array using ESPAR system.
